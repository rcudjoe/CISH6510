        "snippet": "Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-coloured grape varieties. The actual colour of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older reds.",
		"HowToServe": "Serve at 60° to 65° F-cooler than most room temperatures and warmer than ideal cellaring temperatures-to make the tannins in powerful Cabernet or Syrah feel more supple and de-emphasize bitter components."

        "snippet": "White wine is a wine whose color can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, and yellow-gold coloured. White wine's color can be derived from an assortment of grape varieties.",
		"HowToServe": "Serve at 40° to 50° F to preserve their freshness and fruitiness. Think crisp Pinot Grigio and Champagne. For sparklers, chilling keeps bubbles fine rather than frothy. This is also a good range for white dessert wines; sweetness is accentuated at warmer temperatures, so chilling them preserves their balance without quashing their vibrant aromas."
