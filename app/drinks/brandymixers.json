Pare the rind from the orange and lemon, removing and discarding as much of the white pith as possible. Put the cognac, sugar cube, lemon and orange rind in a small pan. Heat gently, then remove from the heat, light a match and pass the flame close to the surface of the liquid. The alcohol will burn with a low, blue flame for about a minute. Blow out the flame. Add the Kahlua to the pan, and strain into a heat-resistant glass.",
