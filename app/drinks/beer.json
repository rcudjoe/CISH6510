		"HowToServe": "Larger should be served well chilled as it is primarily about refreshment rather than the connoisseurial flavor appreciation. It should be pourse fairly quickly into a tall, tilted glass, which should then be righted once it is three-quarters full, so that the last complement of beer forms a luxuriant, feather-light, frothy head. Drink the first beer through the head rather than waiting for it to subside."
