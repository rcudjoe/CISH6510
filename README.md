Ultimate Cocktail Application

This is an easy to use web-based application that provides users basic information and composition of some categories of alcoholic drinks: spirits, liqueurs, wine, beer and cider etc.  The application also provides users with some bartending tips in the areas of what equipment is needed and what techniques should be learned in home bartending. Finally, the application provides users with a variety of cocktail recipes, arranged by type, so that users can happily expand their repertoire of cocktail mixers.
For each category of items displayed, the user can search specific type of drink or mixer/recipe. They can also sort alphabetical order or by the newest items added. For each type of drink displayed, there is a “How to Serve” modal that provides details of the best way to serve a particular drink. Users also have the option to add new types of drinks and descript the best way to serve it. They can also add new recipes for cocktails that are not already listed.
There is a section for users to connect with each other and application owners via email, Facebook, Flickr or Twitter.
